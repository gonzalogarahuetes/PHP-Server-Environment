# PHP-Server-Environment
Small login webpage with php basics. The application fakes a database with usernames and passwords and allows to log in and out. I used superglobal variables, like server and session.


# User
To use the fake database, just log in with the user "newUser" and the password "123456". The app logs you in and gives the option of logging out as well.
